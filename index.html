							In a remarkable endeavour, Tan Zi Xi meticulously gathered, purified, and systematically arranged 500 kilograms of abandoned ocean plastic, totaling over 26,000 individual pieces,
							to bring to life her captivating installation titled "Plastic Ocean." This immersive exhibition, featuring suspended plastic debris in a mesmerising display, serves as a visual narrative,
							effectively highlighting the profound impact of plastic waste on our global marine ecosystems, illustrating how they are slowly suffocated by this pervasive environmental challenge.</p>

					      <p>Goldsworthy generally doesn't create works that preach the word of climate change like some other pieces in this gallery, but still highlights our unbreakable bond to nature, and humans
							impact on it. Goldsworthy here is documenting transformation, and his own impact on the environment around him. At this more raw level, we can take a step back from some of the other, heavier
							change from pieces in this gallery and appreciate a simple impact, and understand other ways simple changes impact the environment around us. This serves as a reminder of our connection to
							nature, but doesn’t directly criticise what that relationship looks like in today's day and age, rather takes a step back and acknowledges it at a more broad level. Goldsworthy provides what
							Some might consider a higher level of insight, many of his works document a raw change in the physical environment regardless of what that change is, related to the Earth's climate or otherwise.

					      <h4>Khian Sea</h4>		      
					      <p>Known for his work in collages and photography, Benjamin West is an artistic force with a deep commitment to tackling environmental issues. He has a unique talent for seamlessly blending the
							natural and technological aspects of our relationship with nature in his collages. A prime example of this is "Khian Sea". By layering organic elements over mechanical and artificial visuals,
							Benjamin prompts us to reflect on societal progression, and how it might impact the environment around us. Through West’s lens, we're invited to engage in a thoughtful introspection, spurring a
							dedication to environmental stewardship as a society. In contrast to some other pieces we see in this exhibition, West takes a more subtle approach, guiding a viewer to a conclusion rather than brute forcing.
							In doing this, a viewer may develop a deeper connection to the works and feel called to action, rather than having direct consequences displayed for viewing.</p>

					      <h4>Birds Watching</h4>		      
					      <p>Jenny Kendler is the creative mind behind this sculpture, Birds Watching, a striking 40-foot installation featuring a 'flock' of one hundred reflective bird's eyes meticulously mounted on aluminium.
							Each eye in this immersive artwork represents a bird species threatened by climate change in the United States. The sculpture's commanding presence, accentuated by the gaze of these eyes, appears
							to lay bare the observers. Unlike our typical one-sided engagement with media, Jenny's avian eyes demand active participation from viewers in the act of observation. Each eye with its own persona and
							personality only further comments on the broad range of consequences of climate change. It is not simply a few species in danger of being wiped off the face of the planet, it is many, and that number
							will only continue to grow as the temperature of our planet and seas continues to rise. The piece posits that we cannot exclude ourselves of responsibility in the face of the climate crisis and emphasises
							our obligation to take meaningful action.</p>

					      <h4>Pile</h4>		      
					      <p>Gavin Turk presents a bag full of discarded products, unrecycled organic matter thrown in with the by-products of our wasteful consumerist lifestyles. Here, we are forced to consider the consequences of a
							consumerist lifestyle, that only results in a larger pile growing not only on land, but in the oceans too. Pile represents just that, albeit in a very blunt and obvious way, but in doing this Turk brings to
							the forefront a piece that serves no other purpose other than to force this dark reflection from the viewer. It seems as though Turk didn’t want any underlying meaning, so that when this piece was discussed
							it was only in the way he intended it to be. Turk additionally challenges here a different idea aimed at our museum choices of curation and display, prompting us to consider what we should be viewing and
							reflecting as an alternative to what we might view today. Turk's comments are defined by what we throw away and conversely we are deconstructed by what we choose to display in our hallowed museum halls.</p>

					      <h4>Ice Watch</h4>		      
					      <p>Ice Watch, by Olafur Eliasson, is a perfect example of the idea of experiencing the reality of climate change. Visitors who encountered the 120 tonnes of Greenlandic glacial ice in London were able to reach
							out and touch the effects of a changing environment. Olafur hopes that this experience will motivate people to become involved and act together to pressure our governments and businesses to make changes on a systemic level,
							which is the only way we will succeed in responding to this crisis. The tonnes of ice hoisted onto the land allows for an observation of the ice melting from its 120 tonne state all the way down to the size of ice cubes,
							documenting not only the way in which a warmer environment affects them, but how volatile these changes in our sea temperature can be. Over time, what was once grand and eye catching, evaporates into the atmosphere.
